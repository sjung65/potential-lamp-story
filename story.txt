There once was a girl named Grace. She lived in New York City. One day she decided to take a trip with her 4 friends to Madison, Wisconsin. 
They spent a wonderful day enjoying the different parts of campus. They explored state street, hung out at the terrace, and went rock climbing at the Sett. They had a wonderful day!
