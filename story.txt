There once was a girl named Grace. She lived in New York City. One day she decided to take a trip with her 4 friends to Madison, Wisconsin. 
They spent a wonderful day enjoying the different parts of campus. They explored state street, hung out at the terrace, and went rock climbing at the Sett. They had a wonderful day! The next day, Grace and her friends headed to the farmer's market around the state capitol building, walked on the Lakeshore Path, and ended their day with trying Babcock ice cream. Unfortunately, that was the last day of their trip to Madison and had to go back home the next day. They were so sad about it. All of them loved this city so much. They took a great picture in front of the capital, and took it home.
